Choose either the Selenium (WSelenium directory) or the Curl (WCurl directory) version.

1) Place the .tar.gz archive in the home directory on the instance that will be used.
2) tar -xzvf P**.tar.gz
3) cd ProjectV1i/
4) ./install.sh
5) Exit the instance and create a snapshot or an image of it in its current state.
6) Once the image is uploaded on Openstack, copy the image ID
7) Go at the top of stack*.yml file and replace the "image_linux" default with the good ID you copied before
8) Create a pile with the good stack*.yml file

===> All the instances launch and start generating network traffic.



NOTE : Currently it is not real time but very accelerated.

You can choose to slow it and the number of days it lasts in :

ProjectV1i/run/EventGeneratorX.py

At the very end of this file you will find a while loop : "while d<1" ---> 1 is for 1 days, 2 for 2 days, etc ...
Also 3 lines before the end you will find the line "time.sleep(result[2]/15) ---> /15 is accelerated
										Change it to *60 for real-time!
